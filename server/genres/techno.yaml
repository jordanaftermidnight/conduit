rhythm_style: >
  Straight, quantized, and relentlessly metronomic. Rhythmic interest comes
  from layering polyrhythmic hat and percussion patterns over an unwavering
  four-on-the-floor kick. Syncopation is used sparingly and deliberately.
  Emphasis on repetition and subtle variation over time rather than complex
  rhythmic phrasing. Ghost notes and flams on percussion create micro-level
  texture without disrupting the grid.

swing: 0.0

instrument_conventions:
  kick:
    - Hard, punchy 909-style kicks with long low-end tail
    - Distorted, clipped kicks for industrial textures
    - Layered kicks with transient click and sub body
  hihats:
    - Closed hats on offbeats or 16th-note patterns
    - Open hats for accent and tension
    - Metallic, filtered, or bitcrushed hat textures
  claps_and_snares:
    - Claps on beats 2 and 4
    - Layered noise-based snares
    - Rimshots for variation
  percussion:
    - Toms (pitched, often tuned to key)
    - Shakers and rides for high-frequency movement
    - Industrial hits, metallic stabs, noise bursts
  synths:
    - Dark, detuned pads for atmosphere
    - Acid basslines (303-style)
    - Stab chords (minor, dissonant)
    - Single-oscillator drones
  effects_sends:
    - Reverb tails on claps and percussion
    - Delay throws on synth stabs
    - Distortion and saturation on bus groups

bass_style: >
  Typically monophonic and rooted in the low-mid range (40-120 Hz). Often
  driven by a 303-style acid line with resonant filter sweeps, or a deep
  sub-bass sine wave locked to the kick pattern. Bass movement is minimal
  in pitch — often staying on one or two notes per phrase — with timbral
  variation (filter cutoff, distortion, FM amount) providing interest.
  Sidechain compression to the kick is standard to create pumping space.

drum_patterns:
  kick: >
    Four-on-the-floor (hits on every quarter note). Variations include
    removing the kick on beat 1 of breakdown sections or adding offbeat
    ghost kicks at low velocity for drive.
  hihat: >
    Eighth or sixteenth note patterns. Common to alternate velocities
    for a mechanical-yet-human feel. Open hats on the "and" of beat 4
    for turnaround accents.
  clap_snare: >
    Hits on beats 2 and 4. Occasional 16th-note rolls or fills before
    section transitions. Sometimes removed entirely for stripped-back
    passages.
  percussion: >
    Polyrhythmic layers of rides, toms, and metallic hits. Often in
    3-against-4 or 5-against-4 groupings to create tension against the
    kick grid. Gradually introduced and removed for arrangement dynamics.

structure:
  phrase_length: 8  # bars per phrase (minimum musical idea)
  section_length: 16  # bars per section (intro, body, breakdown)
  arrangement_length: [64, 128]  # bars total, typical range
  sections:
    - intro (16-32 bars, gradual layering)
    - main loop A (16-32 bars)
    - breakdown (8-16 bars, kick drops out)
    - main loop B (16-32 bars, new element introduced)
    - outro (16-32 bars, gradual stripping)
  notes: >
    Techno arrangements are additive/subtractive: elements are introduced
    and removed one at a time over long periods. Transitions happen at
    8- or 16-bar boundaries. Dramatic changes are rare — the focus is on
    hypnotic evolution. DJ-friendly intros and outros with just kick and
    hats for 16+ bars are standard.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Consistently high energy with subtle dynamic shifts. Loudness is
    relatively constant due to heavy compression and limiting. Dynamic
    interest comes from frequency-domain changes (filter sweeps, EQ
    automation) rather than volume changes. Breakdowns provide the
    primary contrast by removing the kick and low end.
  velocity_range: [80, 127]
  compression: heavy

effects:
  - Reverb (dark, long-tail on percussion; short plate on claps)
  - Delay (ping-pong, tempo-synced dotted-eighth or quarter)
  - Distortion and saturation (on bass, kicks, master bus)
  - Bitcrushing and sample rate reduction
  - High-pass and low-pass filter sweeps
  - Sidechain compression (kick-triggered on bass and pads)
  - Phaser and flanger on synth loops
  - Granular processing on textural elements
