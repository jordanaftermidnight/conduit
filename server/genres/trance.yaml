rhythm_style: >
  Four-on-the-floor kick with relentless, driving energy. The rhythmic
  feel is straight and mechanical, pushing forward with unwavering pulse.
  Offbeat bass notes (on the "and" of each beat) are a genre-defining
  characteristic, creating a bouncing, galloping feel. 16th-note
  arpeggiated synth patterns provide rhythmic and melodic content
  simultaneously. The overall rhythm is built for sustained energy on
  the dance floor, with tension and release cycles created by adding
  and removing the kick drum in breakdowns and builds.

swing: 0.0

instrument_conventions:
  kick:
    - Punchy, mid-focused kick with clear click
    - Less sub-heavy than techno; more mid-range punch
    - Consistent four-on-the-floor pattern
    - Often layered with a sub layer for weight
  bass:
    - Offbeat bass (hits on "and" of each quarter note)
    - Acid-style 303 bass in acid trance
    - Rolling 16th-note basslines
    - Plucked, short-decay bass tones
  hihats:
    - Offbeat open hats (defining pattern)
    - Closed hats on 16th notes for drive
    - Ride cymbal patterns in peak sections
  claps_and_snares:
    - Clap on beats 2 and 4
    - Layered clap with snare for power
    - Clap rolls for build-ups (8th to 16th to 32nd)
  leads:
    - Supersaw leads (multiple detuned saw oscillators)
    - Pluck synths with long delay tails
    - Acid-style squelchy leads
    - Euphoric, soaring lead lines
    - Hoover-style resampled leads
  pads:
    - Warm, lush supersaw pads
    - String-like pad layers
    - Filtered pad sweeps for transitions
    - Ethereal, reverb-drenched atmosphere
  arps:
    - 16th-note arpeggiated sequences (signature element)
    - Gated trance arps with sidechain
    - Minor key arp patterns with filter modulation
    - Layered arps at different octaves
  vocals:
    - Emotional female vocals (full phrases)
    - Chopped vocal hooks
    - Vocal chops as melodic elements
    - Spoken word / motivational speech samples
  fx:
    - Risers (white noise sweeps, pitched risers)
    - Downlifters (reverse risers)
    - Impact hits on drops
    - Reverse cymbals at section boundaries

bass_style: >
  The classic trance bassline sits on the offbeats — hitting on the "and"
  of each quarter note, creating the genre's signature bouncing rhythm
  when combined with the on-beat kick. Bass sounds are typically short
  and plucky with fast decay, using saw-based patches with moderate
  filter cutoff. The bass occupies the 60-200 Hz range with presence
  harmonics up to 500 Hz. In acid trance, a 303-style bass with
  resonant filter sweeps replaces the standard offbeat pattern. Rolling
  16th-note basslines are common in harder styles. The bass pattern
  usually follows the root note of the chord progression, occasionally
  adding passing notes.

drum_patterns:
  kick: >
    Straight four-on-the-floor on every quarter note. Unvarying and
    driving. The kick is removed during breakdowns (8-32 bars) and
    reintroduced at the drop for maximum impact. No ghost kicks or
    syncopation — the kick is a metronome.
  hihat: >
    Open hat on every offbeat (eighth-note "ands") is the primary
    pattern. Closed hats on 16th notes layer underneath for drive.
    Hats continue through breakdowns (sometimes filtered) to maintain
    pulse even when kick drops out.
  clap_snare: >
    Clap on beats 2 and 4, steady and consistent. In build-ups, the
    clap accelerates from quarter notes to eighths to 16ths to 32nds,
    creating a snare roll that peaks at the drop. Reverb tail on claps
    adds space.
  percussion: >
    Minimal percussion beyond the core kick-hat-clap pattern. Occasional
    ride cymbal in peak sections. Shaker on 16th notes in some styles.
    Trance relies on synth layers rather than percussion for complexity.

structure:
  phrase_length: 8
  section_length: 16
  arrangement_length: [128, 192]  # trance tracks are typically long
  sections:
    - intro (16-32 bars, kick and bass establish groove)
    - build A (16 bars, arps and pads introduced)
    - breakdown 1 (16-32 bars, kick drops out, melodic/vocal focus)
    - build-up 1 (8-16 bars, rising energy, snare roll, riser FX)
    - drop/climax 1 (16-32 bars, full energy, lead melody)
    - breakdown 2 (16-32 bars, emotional peak, vocals or piano)
    - build-up 2 (8-16 bars)
    - drop/climax 2 (16-32 bars, variation or new melody)
    - outro (16-32 bars, stripped back for DJ mixing)
  notes: >
    Trance arrangements are long and follow a clear tension-release arc.
    The breakdown is the emotional heart of the track — where pads,
    vocals, and melodies are showcased without drums. The build-up creates
    anticipation through snare rolls, rising FX, and filter sweeps. The
    drop is the release — full drums, bass, leads, and arps hitting
    together. This breakdown-build-drop cycle typically happens twice.
    The overall arrangement arc goes from sparse to full to sparse to
    even fuller. DJ intros and outros are long (16-32 bars of just
    kick and bass) for mixing.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Extreme dynamic arc within a track. Breakdowns are quiet and
    emotional, builds are tense and rising, drops are maximum energy.
    This tension-release cycle is the genre's defining structural
    feature. The drop after a long breakdown should feel like an
    explosion of energy. Between drops, energy remains high and
    consistent. The overall loudness is high due to heavy mastering,
    but the perceived dynamic range from breakdown to drop is wide.
  velocity_range: [70, 127]
  compression: heavy (especially on master bus)

effects:
  - Reverb (large hall on leads, pads, and claps; defining trance sound)
  - Delay (tempo-synced dotted-eighth on plucks and leads; creates rhythmic echo)
  - Sidechain compression (kick to bass, kick to pads, kick to arps; creates pumping)
  - High-pass filter sweeps (on breakdowns, slow sweep up before drop)
  - Low-pass filter sweeps (on arps and leads for tension)
  - White noise risers (sweep up over 8-32 bars before drops)
  - Gating (trance gate on pads, rhythmic chopping)
  - Chorus and unison (for thickening supersaw sounds)
  - Stereo widening (on pads and leads for expansive sound)
  - Distortion (subtle, on bass and leads for presence)
  - Pitch automation (subtle pitch bend up on risers)
