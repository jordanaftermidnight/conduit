rhythm_style: >
  Breakbeat-based with heavy syncopation. The core rhythmic identity
  derives from chopped, rearranged, and time-stretched breakbeats —
  particularly the Amen break, Think break, and Apache break. Kick
  and snare interplay is the primary rhythmic engine: kick on beat 1,
  snare on beat 2 (the "half-bar"), with intricate ghost notes, rolls,
  and fills between. The feel is urgent and propulsive, with the high
  tempo creating a sense of forward momentum. Syncopated 16th-note
  hat and ride patterns layer over the breaks for additional drive.

swing: 0.05

instrument_conventions:
  kick:
    - Punchy, tight kick with fast decay
    - Layered sub-kick for weight
    - Often tuned to the key of the track
  snare:
    - Sharp, cracking snare on the half-bar (beat 3 in half-time feel)
    - Layered break snare with synthetic snare
    - Ghost snares at low velocity for groove
    - Snare rolls (16th and 32nd note) for fills
  hihats:
    - Rapid 16th-note closed hats
    - Offbeat open hats for shuffle
    - Ride cymbal patterns for liquid/jazz-influenced styles
  breaks:
    - Chopped and rearranged Amen break
    - Think break derivatives
    - Apache and Funky Drummer chops
    - Layered live breaks with programmed elements
  bass:
    - Reese bass (detuned saw oscillators)
    - Deep sub bass (sine wave, 30-60 Hz)
    - Wobble bass with LFO modulation
    - Neuro bass (FM synthesis, heavy processing)
  synths:
    - Atmospheric pads (reverb-drenched)
    - Stab chords (minor 7ths, minor 9ths)
    - Arp sequences in liquid styles
    - Dark drones for neurofunk
  vocals:
    - Chopped ragga/MC vocal samples
    - Ethereal female vocals in liquid DnB
    - Time-stretched vocal textures
    - Vocal chops as rhythmic elements

bass_style: >
  Sub-bass is the backbone, sitting in the 30-80 Hz range with enormous
  weight. The classic Reese bass (two detuned sawtooth oscillators) is
  a genre-defining sound, creating a growling, phasing texture. Bass
  movement follows the syncopated rhythm of the drums rather than a
  steady pattern — bass notes often land on offbeats and tie across bar
  lines. In neurofunk, the bass is heavily processed with distortion,
  FM synthesis, and filtering to create aggressive, metallic timbres.
  In liquid DnB, bass is smoother and more melodic. Sub frequencies are
  almost always mono and sidechained to the kick.

drum_patterns:
  kick: >
    Primary hit on beat 1. Secondary hit often on the "and" of beat 2
    or beat 3. The two-step pattern (kick on 1, snare on 3) is
    foundational but heavily ornamented with ghost kicks on 16th-note
    subdivisions. Kick patterns are syncopated and interact tightly
    with the bass.
  snare: >
    Primary hit on beat 3 (half-bar position in 4/4 at this tempo,
    giving the half-time feel). Ghost snares on various 16th-note
    positions. Snare rolls — 16th and 32nd notes — for transitions
    and fills, often with rising pitch or filter.
  hihat: >
    Sixteenth-note patterns with velocity accents. Open hat on offbeats
    for groove. Rapid closed hat runs for energy. Rides used in
    jazz-influenced and liquid substyles.
  breaks: >
    Chopped breakbeats layered under or replacing programmed drums.
    The Amen break chop is sliced into individual hits and rearranged
    into new patterns while retaining the original break's energy and
    character. Time-stretching and pitch-shifting create variations.

structure:
  phrase_length: 8
  section_length: 16
  arrangement_length: [64, 128]
  sections:
    - intro (16 bars, atmospheric build or stripped drums)
    - first drop (16 bars, full drums and bass)
    - breakdown (8-16 bars, melodic/atmospheric interlude)
    - second drop (16-32 bars, variation on first drop)
    - breakdown 2 (8-16 bars, optional)
    - final drop (16 bars)
    - outro (16 bars, stripped for DJ mixing)
  notes: >
    DnB tracks revolve around the "drop" — the moment when full drums
    and bass hit together. Breakdowns strip back to pads, vocals, or
    sparse percussion to create contrast. The drop is the peak energy
    moment. Arrangements often feature two or three distinct drops with
    variation in the bass sound or drum pattern. Intros and outros are
    typically drum-focused for DJ mixing.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Extreme dynamic contrast between breakdowns (quiet, atmospheric)
    and drops (maximum energy, full frequency spectrum). The drops
    themselves are heavily compressed for impact. Velocity programming
    on ghost notes and hats is critical for groove. The high BPM creates
    inherent energy, so breakdowns need to strip back significantly to
    provide contrast.
  velocity_range: [40, 127]
  compression: heavy

effects:
  - Reverb (large hall on snares, atmospheric pads)
  - Delay (tempo-synced, filtered feedback for dub influence)
  - Distortion and saturation (on bass, breaks, bus groups)
  - Resampling and granular processing (on breaks and bass)
  - Time-stretching (on breaks for texture)
  - High-pass filter sweeps (for build-ups)
  - Sidechain compression (kick to bass, essential)
  - Stereo widening on pads and atmospheric elements
  - Bit-crushing on breaks for grit
