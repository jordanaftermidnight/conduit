rhythm_style: >
  Four-on-the-floor kick with a slight shuffle or swing applied to
  hi-hats and percussion. The groove is warm and inviting, descended
  from disco and soul. Syncopated bass and chord stabs interact with
  the straight kick to create a push-pull feel. Offbeat open hats are
  a defining characteristic. Conga and hand percussion patterns add
  organic, human-feeling rhythmic layers.

swing: 0.15

instrument_conventions:
  kick:
    - Deep, round 909-style kick
    - Warm, boomy kicks with moderate attack
    - Less distorted than techno; clean low end
  hihats:
    - Offbeat open hats (signature house sound)
    - Shuffled closed hats on 16th notes
    - Shakers and tambourines doubling hat patterns
  claps_and_snares:
    - Claps on beats 2 and 4
    - Layered clap with snare for body
    - Finger snaps for minimal sections
  percussion:
    - Congas and bongos (often with swing)
    - Cowbell on quarter or eighth notes
    - Ride cymbal for drive
    - Tambourine on offbeats
  keys_and_chords:
    - Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric piano
    - Juno-style pad chords
    - Organ stabs (gospel/soul influence)
    - 7th and 9th chord voicings (Cmaj7, Dm9, etc.)
  synths:
    - Warm analog pads
    - Stabby brass-like chords
    - Filtered saw leads
  vocals:
    - Chopped vocal samples
    - Diva vocal hooks
    - Spoken word and vocal ad-libs
    - Gospel-influenced vocal runs

bass_style: >
  Warm, round, and melodic. Typically follows root-fifth patterns or
  walking basslines influenced by disco and funk. Sits in the 50-150 Hz
  range with harmonic content up to 400 Hz for presence. Often played
  with a slight swing to match the groove. Basslines are more melodically
  active than in techno, frequently outlining chord changes. Classic
  house bass uses Moog-style or Juno-106 patches with moderate filter
  cutoff and subtle resonance.

drum_patterns:
  kick: >
    Four-on-the-floor on every quarter note. Consistent and steady,
    providing the foundation. Occasionally a ghost kick on the "and"
    of beat 3 for extra push.
  hihat: >
    Open hat on every offbeat (eighth note "ands") is the defining
    pattern. Closed hats on 16th notes with swing applied, velocity
    accents creating a shuffled groove. Pedal hat on quarter notes
    underneath.
  clap_snare: >
    Beats 2 and 4 with clap as primary sound. Sometimes a rim click
    substitutes in stripped-down sections. 16th-note clap rolls for
    fills at phrase endings.
  percussion: >
    Conga patterns following tumbao-inspired rhythms. Shakers on 16th
    notes with swing matching the hats. Cowbell on offbeats or quarter
    notes for drive.

structure:
  phrase_length: 8
  section_length: 16
  arrangement_length: [64, 128]
  sections:
    - intro (16 bars, drums and percussion build)
    - verse/groove A (16-32 bars, main groove with bass)
    - breakdown (8-16 bars, melodic/vocal focus, kick drops)
    - build (4-8 bars, rising energy back to groove)
    - groove B (16-32 bars, full arrangement)
    - breakdown 2 (8-16 bars)
    - final groove (16-32 bars)
    - outro (16 bars, elements stripped for DJ mixing)
  notes: >
    House tracks are more song-oriented than techno, often featuring
    clear verse-chorus-like sections with vocal hooks. Breakdowns are
    musical moments rather than just tension — often featuring piano
    or vocal solos. Energy arc is a gentle wave rather than a constant
    plateau. 8-bar and 16-bar phrasing is strict for DJ compatibility.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Moderate to high energy with more dynamic range than techno.
    Breakdowns create genuine drops in energy, and builds restore it
    gradually. Velocity variation is important for human feel,
    especially on percussion and keys. The mix is warm and round
    rather than aggressive.

  compression: moderate

  - Phaser on strings and pads
  - Low-pass filter sweeps on synth loops
  - Sidechain compression (subtle, musical pumping)
  - Tape saturation on bass and master
  - Vinyl crackle and noise for texture
