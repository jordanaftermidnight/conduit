name: Dubstep

bpm_range: [138, 142]
# Note: Dubstep is written at 138-142 BPM but felt in half-time at 69-71 BPM.
# The snare hits on beat 3 of the full-tempo bar, creating the half-time feel.
# When generating MIDI, program at the full BPM but think in half-time phrases.

rhythm_style: >
  Half-time feel over a double-time BPM. The snare or clap lands on beat 3
  of each bar (at full tempo), giving a slow, heavy, head-nodding groove
  when felt in half-time. Rhythmic space is a defining characteristic —
  patterns are sparse with deliberate gaps that let the sub bass breathe.
  Syncopation comes from the bass rhythm rather than the drums. Triplet
  subdivisions appear in some patterns, especially in more modern variants.
  The overall feel is heavy, cavernous, and weighted.

swing: 0.0

instrument_conventions:
  kick:
    - Deep, sub-heavy kick with long tail
    - Often tuned low (D1-G1) and blended with sub bass
    - Tight, punchy kick for contrast in sections without sub
  snare_clap:
    - Snare on beat 3 (half-time position)
    - Tight, clipped snare in the Deep Medi style
    - Reverb-drenched snare in atmospheric sections
    - Clap layered with snare for crack
  hihats:
    - Sparse, offbeat hat patterns
    - Shuffled 16th-note hats at low velocity
    - Minimal — often just a few hits per bar
  percussion:
    - Sparse hand percussion (bongos, congas)
    - Dub-influenced percussion stabs
    - Metallic hits and scraped textures
    - Woodblocks and rim clicks for space
  bass:
    - Massive sub bass (sine or low-passed triangle)
    - Wobble bass (LFO on filter cutoff)
    - "Weight" — sustained sub notes that define the genre
    - Bass sits in 30-80 Hz range, almost purely sub
  synths:
    - Dark, sparse pads and drones
    - Minor chord stabs (reverbed, delayed)
    - Eerie melodic fragments
    - Detuned square wave leads
  vocals:
    - Dub-style vocal echoes
    - Ragga and MC samples
    - Ghostly, processed vocal textures
    - Sparse vocal phrases, heavily effected

bass_style: >
  The sub bass IS dubstep. Enormous, room-shaking sine wave sub bass in
  the 30-60 Hz range is the genre's defining characteristic. Bass notes
  are long, sustained, and often slide between pitches (portamento).
  The "wobble" — an LFO modulating filter cutoff on a bass note — is
  a signature technique, though deep/minimal dubstep uses it sparingly.
  Bass patterns are rhythmic but spacious, often syncopated against the
  drums with rests that create tension. In DMZ/Deep Medi style, the sub
  is clean and pure; in more aggressive styles, it's layered with
  mid-range harmonics and distortion. Always mono below 100 Hz.

drum_patterns:
  kick: >
    Hit on beat 1 of each half-time bar (beats 1 and 3 at full BPM).
    Additional ghost kicks sometimes appear on offbeat 16th notes.
    The kick often blends into or is replaced by the sub bass on the
    downbeat. Sparse — sometimes only 2-4 kicks per full-tempo bar.
  snare: >
    Single hit on beat 3 at full BPM (beat 2 in half-time feel). This
    is the defining rhythmic marker. Occasionally doubled with a ghost
    snare. Snare rolls (16th or 32nd notes) are used sparingly for
    transitions. The snare is tight and dry in deep dubstep, more
    reverbed in atmospheric variants.
  hihat: >
    Extremely sparse. A few offbeat hits per bar, or shuffled 16th
    notes at very low velocity. Space is more important than pattern.
    Some tracks have no programmed hats at all, relying on percussion
    and the breaks for high-frequency content.
  percussion: >
    Dub-influenced: sparse hand drums, rim clicks, and metallic hits
    placed irregularly to create an off-kilter, spacious groove.
    Percussion often has heavy delay and reverb, creating rhythmic
    echoes that fill the space between hits.

structure:
  phrase_length: 8  # bars in half-time feel (16 bars at full BPM)
  section_length: 16  # half-time bars
  arrangement_length: [48, 96]  # half-time bars
  sections:
    - intro (8-16 bars, atmospheric, sparse percussion)
    - build (4-8 bars, rising tension, drums establish)
    - drop (16 bars, full sub bass and drums)
    - breakdown (8-16 bars, sub drops out, atmospheric)
    - second drop (16 bars, variation or different bass pattern)
    - outro (8-16 bars, elements stripped)
  notes: >
    Dubstep tracks are spacious and rely on tension between presence
    and absence. The drop — when sub bass enters — is the focal point.
    Arrangements are relatively short compared to techno or house.
    Space and silence are compositional tools. Sections breathe and
    transitions are often marked by drum fills, risers, or simply
    removing elements. The 2-bar loop is a common compositional unit
    within drops.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Extreme contrast between quiet, atmospheric passages and
    earth-shaking drops. The sub bass dominates the dynamic range
    when present. Breakdowns can be very quiet and sparse. The
    half-time feel gives everything a heavy, weighted quality.
    Velocity is generally moderate-to-high on main hits with wide
    variation on ghost notes and percussion.
  velocity_range: [50, 127]
  compression: moderate to heavy on drums, light on sub

effects:
  - Reverb (massive hall/cave reverb on snares and percussion)
  - Delay (dub-style delay with high feedback, filtered)
  - Sub-bass enhancement and saturation
  - High-pass filtering for builds
  - Sidechain compression (kick to sub bass)
  - Spring reverb on percussion (dub influence)
  - Vinyl crackle and dark ambient textures
  - Pitch-shifting and tape stop effects
  - Echo and feedback loops (dub tradition)
