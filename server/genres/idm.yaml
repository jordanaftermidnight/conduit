# Some tracks may use tempo automation or have no consistent BPM.

rhythm_style: >
  Complex, broken, and frequently irregular. IDM rhythm deconstructs
  conventional electronic beat patterns into fragmented, polyrhythmic,
  and often unpredictable sequences. Beats may follow odd time signatures,
  shift between meters, or use generative/algorithmic approaches where
  patterns evolve procedurally. Glitchy micro-edits — rapid-fire sliced
  drums, stutters, and granular bursts — are signature techniques. At the
  same time, some IDM maintains a recognizable groove beneath the
  complexity (Boards of Canada's head-nod loops, Squarepusher's breakbeat
  virtuosity). Polymetric layering — different elements in different time
  signatures simultaneously — creates dense rhythmic tapestries.

swing: 0.0
# Swing in the conventional sense does not apply. Rhythmic feel comes
# from complex programming rather than swing offset.

    - Vocal granular clouds
    - Sampled and heavily manipulated speech

bass_style: >
  Bass in IDM varies widely. It can be a deep, clean sub foundation
  anchoring chaotic upper layers, or it can be as glitchy and fragmented
  as the drums. FM synthesis bass with complex modulation envelopes is
  common, creating timbres that evolve rapidly within each note. In
  Squarepusher-influenced styles, the bass is virtuosic and rapid,
  almost like a slap-bass guitar programmed at inhuman speeds. In more
  ambient IDM (Boards of Canada), bass is warm and lo-fi, sitting low
  in the mix. Autechre-style bass uses abstract synthesis with no
  conventional "bass sound" at all — just low-frequency energy from
  complex synthesis.

drum_patterns:
  general: >
    IDM drum programming is where the genre distinguishes itself most.
    Patterns are rarely loops in the conventional sense. Instead, they
    evolve, mutate, and shift throughout the track.
  approaches:
    - Algorithmic/generative: patterns generated by probability, Euclidean
      rhythms, or cellular automata-like processes
    - Breakbeat deconstruction: Amen and Think breaks chopped into
      individual transients and reassembled in non-linear order
    - Polymetric: different drum elements (kick, snare, hat) in different
      time signatures creating shifting phase relationships
    - Glitch: rapid-fire 32nd and 64th note micro-edits, stutter effects,
      granular bursts of percussion
    - Minimal: sparse, irregular hits with long silences between
  velocity: >
    Extreme velocity variation is critical. Ghost notes, accents, and
    dynamic rolls create texture and interest. Velocity may be
    algorithmically mapped (e.g., following a sine curve or random walk).

structure:
  phrase_length: variable  # 4-16 bars, often irregular
  section_length: variable  # no fixed section lengths
  arrangement_length: [32, 128]
  sections:
    - opening (variable, establishes texture or rhythm)
    - section A (rhythmic/melodic idea explored)
    - transition (gradual or abrupt shift)
    - section B (contrasting idea or evolution of A)
    - section C (further development, optional)
    - climax or peak complexity (dense layering)
    - resolution (stripping back, dissolving)
  notes: >
    IDM structure is experimental and track-dependent. Some tracks follow
    loose verse-chorus patterns; others are through-composed with no
    repetition. Sections may be asymmetric (a 7-bar section followed by
    a 13-bar section). Transitions can be smooth crossfades or abrupt
    jump-cuts. The arrangement should serve the sonic ideas rather than
    conforming to a template. That said, there is usually a discernible
    arc — introduction of ideas, development, peak, resolution — even
    if it does not follow conventional bar lengths.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Wide dynamic range with sudden contrasts. Quiet, delicate passages
    may be interrupted by bursts of noise or dense percussion. Micro-
    dynamics are extremely detailed — individual hits vary significantly
    in velocity and timbre. The overall loudness profile can be
    unpredictable. Compression is used creatively (sidechain pumping,
    extreme ratio settings for effect) rather than just for loudness.
  velocity_range: [1, 127]
  compression: creative and varied

effects:
  - Granular processing (primary sound design tool)
  - Reverb (from tight rooms to infinite spaces, used expressively)
  - Delay (complex, modulated, ping-pong, filtered, multi-tap)
  - Bit-crushing and sample rate reduction
  - Time-stretching and pitch-shifting (extreme settings)
  - Ring modulation and frequency shifting
  - Spectral processing (freeze, blur, resynthesis)
  - Convolution with unusual impulse responses
  - Feedback loops (controlled, self-generating)
  - Waveshaping and complex distortion
  - Vocoding and formant processing
  - Stutter and buffer effects
  - Generative modulation (random LFOs, S&H, chaos algorithms)
