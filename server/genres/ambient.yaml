name: Ambient

bpm_range: [60, 120]
# Note: Many ambient works have no fixed tempo or use extremely slow,
# fluid tempos. When generating MIDI, a tempo may be set for the DAW
# session but rhythm should be free-flowing and non-metronomic.
# Alternatively, use tempo automation for gradual drift.

rhythm_style: >
  Largely non-rhythmic or free-time. When rhythmic elements are present,
  they are slow, sparse, and organic — often implied by the natural attack
  and decay of sounds rather than by programmed beats. Pulse may emerge
  from repeating delay patterns, granular textures, or slow LFO modulation
  rather than from drums. When tempo is present, it is felt loosely and
  may drift. The emphasis is on sustained tones, gradual evolution, and
  the absence of rhythmic urgency.

swing: 0.0

instrument_conventions:
  pads:
    - Lush, evolving pad textures (wavetable, granular, subtractive)
    - Layered pad voices with slow attack and long release
    - Shimmer pads (pitch-shifted reverb feedback)
    - Spectral pads from processed field recordings
  drones:
    - Sustained bass drones (sine, triangle, processed)
    - Harmonic drones with slow beating and detuning
    - Bowed string or wind instrument drones (sampled or synthesized)
    - Feedback drones from guitar or synth
  textures:
    - Field recordings (nature, urban, industrial)
    - Granular synthesis clouds
    - Tape loops and degraded recordings
    - Processed noise (filtered, modulated)
  melodic:
    - Sparse piano notes with heavy reverb
    - Guitar (clean, volume-swelled, e-bowed)
    - Bell-like tones (FM synthesis, celesta, glockenspiel samples)
    - Slow, simple melodic fragments (2-5 notes)
  percussion:
    - Mostly absent
    - When present: soft, muted hits (brushes, mallets)
    - Processed found-sound percussion
    - Delay-derived rhythmic textures
  vocals:
    - Wordless vocal pads (processed, layered)
    - Whispered or distant spoken word
    - Choir-like textures (heavily reverbed)
    - Granular vocal processing

bass_style: >
  Bass in ambient is typically a low drone or sustained tone rather than
  a rhythmic pattern. Frequencies sit in the 40-100 Hz range, often as a
  warm sine or triangle wave foundation. Movement comes from slow filter
  modulation, subtle pitch drift, or harmonic beating between detuned
  oscillators. Bass notes may sustain for entire sections (8-32 bars or
  longer) with only the timbre evolving. When bass does move melodically,
  it follows very slow root motion — whole notes or longer, often just
  moving between two pitches a fourth or fifth apart.

drum_patterns:
  general: >
    Drums are typically absent in ambient music. When rhythmic elements
    appear, they are textural rather than groove-based.
  when_present: >
    Extremely sparse: perhaps a single muted kick every 4-8 bars, or
    a soft cymbal swell marking a section. Found-sound percussion may
    appear irregularly. Delay and reverb on any percussive element
    should be extensive, blurring individual hits into washes of sound.
  rhythmic_textures: >
    Instead of drums, rhythm may emerge from: repeating delay patterns
    on melodic elements, granular density modulation, LFO-driven
    amplitude changes on pads, or the natural rhythm of field recordings
    (waves, rain, machinery).

structure:
  phrase_length: 16  # bars (or equivalent duration)
  section_length: 32  # bars, very long sections
  arrangement_length: [64, 256]  # bars; ambient tracks are often very long
  sections:
    - opening (32+ bars, single element slowly introduced)
    - development A (32+ bars, layers gradually added)
    - development B (32+ bars, timbral evolution)
    - climax or peak density (16-32 bars, most layers present)
    - dissolution (32+ bars, gradual removal of elements)
    - closing (16-32 bars, return to sparse texture or silence)
  notes: >
    Ambient structure is non-traditional and organic. There are no drops,
    builds, or breakdowns in the conventional sense. Instead, the piece
    evolves continuously through additive and subtractive layering. Changes
    happen over very long time scales — a filter sweep might take 32 bars.
    Repetition is embraced but always with micro-variation. Sections blend
    into each other rather than having hard transitions. The piece should
    feel like a single, continuous arc rather than a sequence of parts.
    Fade-ins and fade-outs are common at the start and end.

dynamics:
  overall: >
    Very wide dynamic range. Ambient music is typically quiet, with gentle
    swells and recessions in volume. The loudest moments are still moderate
    by electronic music standards. Dynamics evolve slowly and smoothly —
    no sudden jumps in volume. Automation of volume, filter, and effect
    parameters over long periods is the primary dynamic tool. The music
    should be listenable at very low volumes while also rewarding close
    attention at higher levels.
  velocity_range: [20, 100]
  compression: minimal to none

effects:
  - Reverb (massive, long-tail algorithmic reverb; shimmer reverb)
  - Delay (long, filtered, high feedback for self-generating patterns)
  - Granular processing (time-stretching, freeze, scatter)
  - Pitch shifting (octave up in reverb feedback for shimmer)
  - Chorus and ensemble (slow, deep modulation for width)
  - Tape saturation (warm, gentle harmonic addition)
  - Spectral processing (spectral blur, freeze, smear)
  - Convolution reverb (real spaces: cathedrals, caves, forests)
  - Ring modulation (subtle, for metallic overtones)
  - Paulstretch and extreme time-stretching
  - Volume automation (slow swells over many bars)
